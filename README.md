# Emotion_detection_in_video_calls
 This project is an AI-powered system designed to analyze facial expressions, voice tone, and body language during video calls to detect emotions such as happiness, stress, and frustration. It aims to enhance customer service, HR management, and virtual team communication.  Built using OpenCV, Librosa, pretrained models like WebRTC, React, and Flask, this solution bridges AI and real-time video communication seamlessly.
